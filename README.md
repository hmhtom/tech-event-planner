# Tech-Event-Planner

## Description:

Tech Event Planer is a platform for finding and building Tech communities. People use Tech Event to meet new people from the same field, learn new things, find support, get out of their comfort zones, and pursue their IT skills, together.

As a user interested in tech, I want to be able to access a website where I can view all the Tech events, get event details and attend events. Also as a user I want to be able to sign up and create an event for other users to attend.
